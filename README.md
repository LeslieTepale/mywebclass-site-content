# MyWebClass collaboration and brainstorming activity to identify required content for mywebclass

The purpose of this assignment is to practice collaborating using GIT/GitHub and to do this you need to create a list of things that you have learned in this class, things that you don't understand, and things that you want to know more about.  

## Instructions
Collaborating on GitHub:

1. Fork the repository: Each person should fork the repository to their own GitHub account. To do this, click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.
2. Enable issues: If you don't see the "Issues" tab in the main menu, you should enable it in the repository settings. Go to the "Issues" tab, and click "Milestones" to add a 0.1.0 milestone and describe it as a consolidated list of issues from your team.
3. Create tasks: Go to the "Project" board, and create one task for every item in your list in the "To do" column. Once you have all your tasks, pick the top task and assign it to yourself, mark it as "documentation," assign it to the 0.1.0 milestone, and click "Open in new tab" to go to the issue page and create a branch for it. Once it's all set and you're ready to work on it, move it to the "In progress" column.
4. Clone the repository and checkout the issue branch: Once you have a branch, you will need to clone the repository and type "git fetch" to see any new branches. Then, checkout the issue branch of the issue that you will work on.
5. Add your changes and push the branch: Once you have checked out the issue branch, add your changes to the README.md file, and then push the branch back to GitHub.
6. Make a pull request and close the issue: Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. In the message when you go to merge the pull request, you need to type "closes #" (e.g., "closes #1"). After you merge the pull request, it will move your task card for that issue from "In progress" to "Done."
7. Collaborate with your partner: By this time, your partner should have completed their task as well, and they can make a pull request to merge their feature into the owner's repository. Only the owner of the repository can actually merge. You may get merge conflicts, but you can reduce the likelihood of a conflict by making sure that both partners' repo's master branch is updated and that the branch you are submitting a pull request for is up-to-date with master on both repositories.
